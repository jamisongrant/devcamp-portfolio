          <p>My name is Jamie. I enjoy video games and music, which both explain my obsession with computers. Throughout my younger years, I played competitive online games while jamming out to all kinds of music, which later became an obsession to learning music and learning code.

          I have completed two years of college as well as full-stack accelerated classes at Bottega Tech. I am interested in the studies of Computer Science and I believe it is key to balance science with art. I express myself as lead singer & rhythm guitarist in the band <em>Widow Case</em>. </p>
